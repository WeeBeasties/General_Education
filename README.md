# General_Education #  
The purpose of this project is to create a completely open and sustainable workflow for analyzing and reporting assessment data pertaining to student learning in the General Education program at Ferris State University. All data, R scripts, and reports will be housed in General Education repos and shared via a site in the Open Science Framework. The main page is located at: [https://osf.io/bax9i/].  
The aggregate.R file in this repo is used to load data from data workbooks in a folder and combine them to make a single, tidy, and de-identified data set. This script is used to produce all the working datasets in the other General Education repos in our overall project.
